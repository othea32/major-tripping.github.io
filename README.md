MAJOR-TRIPPING 
Is a travel advisory app. 

This app is able to find local Resturants, hotels and attraction around the world.

There is a Map on the right which will show the area Resturants in a card which will display an image along with a rating of 3+, 4+ or 4.5+

When a card is clicked on the map the right side of the app. will scoll to the individual card which will have all the info of the Resturants, Hotel or Attraction.
  -- Name, Address, Phone #
  -- link to the website if any
  -- the Ratings if any
  -- link to Grubhub or other external sites
  
Material UI was used for styling the Header, list etc.

Used 2 api's
  -- Google Maps API used for the mapping of locations around the world.
  -- Travel Advisory API used to get location of Resturants, Hotels and Attractions.

Future Task:
  -- add a Weather api for the weather in the area
  -- add retail api for the local retail in the area

To be worked on/fixed:
  -- the search bar doesn't function properly, but you are able to pan and zoom in & out all over the map to other countries.

Personal challanges:
  -- using Material UI
  -- adding the right info needed to the api



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
